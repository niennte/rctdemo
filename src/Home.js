    <p>I am a full stack web engineer based in Toronto, Canada.</p>
    <p>I work with clients building holistic APIs and I apply information architecture potions to craft elegant solutions in both front end and back end.</p>
    <p>Also, I meditate, compose and record music, sail, paraglide, kitesurf, and for rest of the time, keep myself fit by opening doors for the two cats who own me.</p>
