    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>I am a full stack web engineer based in Toronto, Canada.</p>

    <p>I work to bring together art and logic to craft elegant, robust, user centered applications, web services, and APIs. I code in JavaScript, PHP and Java. My present favorites are React, Spring Framework, AWS services, and containers. I have background in informatics and languages, and experience in frontend development, UX design, relational databases (mySQL, Postgres), and backend web applications development (PHP, Java).
    </p>

    <p>When out of computer chair, I keep myself fit by opening doors for the two cats that live with me. Also, I like to travel the world, mix with different cultures, learn languages, read, hike in wilderness, meditate, and compose music.</p>

    <p>Before I die, I would like to try myself in data architecture, write a SciFi book, sky dive, and see polar bears. </p>
